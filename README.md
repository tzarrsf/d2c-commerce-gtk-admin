# Get to Know D2C Commerce for Administrators Data and Code Examples for Partner Learning Camp (aka d2c-commerce-gtk-admin)

### Preamble

The data and code samples in this repository are not organized in a traditional "developer package" deployable from an IDE such as Visual Studio Code; That is very much 'by design.' SFDX packages can be unwieldly for Administrators who just want to stand up an environment, place orders and test out new features without having to dive into matters like coding tasks, tooling and its setup which is a topic entirely on its own.
